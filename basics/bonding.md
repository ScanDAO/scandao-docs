# Minting

## What is minting?

**Minting is the secondary value accrual strategy of ScanDAO.** It allows ScanDAO
to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets such as LUSD by selling SCAN
at a discount in exchange for these assets. The protocol quotes the bonder with
terms such as the bond price, the amount of SCAN tokens entitled to the bonder, and
the vesting term. The bonder can claim some of the rewards (SCAN tokens) as they
vest, and at the end of the vesting term, the full amount will be claimable.

**Minting is an active, short-term strategy.** The price discovery mechanism of the secondary bond market renders bond discounts more or less unpredictable. Therefore minting is considered a more active investment strategy that has to be monitored constantly in order to be more profitable as compared to staking.

**Minting allows ScanDAO to accumulate its own liquidity.** We call our own liquidity [POL](../references/glossary.md#pol). More POL ensures there is always locked exit liquidity in our trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders. Since ScanDAO becomes its own market, on top of additional certainty for SCAN investors, the protocol accrues more and more revenue from LP rewards bolstering our treasury.
