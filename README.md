# Introduction

## What is ScanDAO?

ScanDAO is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the SCAN token. Each SCAN token is backed by a basket of assets \(e.g. BUSD\) in the ScanDAO treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. ScanDAO also introduces unique economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and bonding.

## What is the point of ScanDAO?

Our goal is to build a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the SCAN token is controlled at a high level by the DAO. In the long term, we believe this system can be used to optimize for stability and consistency so that SCAN can function as a global unit-of-account and medium-of-exchange currency. In the short term, we intend to optimize the system for growth and wealth creation.

## How do I participate in ScanDAO?

There are two main strategies for market participants: [staking](basics/staking.md) and [bonding](basics/bonding.md). Stakers stake their SCAN tokens in return for more SCAN tokens, while bonders provide LP or BUSD tokens in exchange for discounted SCAN tokens after a fixed vesting period.

Governance participants can get involved through discussions on our [community discord](https://discord.com/invite/scandao) and [DAO discord](https://discord.gg/ythKKHq634) servers respectively. We are always looking for new community members to contribute!

## How can I benefit from ScanDAO?

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new SCAN tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price \(due to inflation\), stakers would make a profit.

The main benefit for bonders comes from price consistency. Bonders commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in SCAN and thus the bonder's profit would depend on SCAN price when the bond matures. Bonders benefit from a rising or static SCAN price.

## Who created ScanDAO?

ScanDAO was ideated by Zeus and built by a distributed pseudo-anonymous team.

## Who runs ScanDAO?

No one. ScanDAO is DAO-governed. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through snapshot voting.
