# Bonds

## BUSD Bond

All bond contracts are more or less the same, with the one exception of the
assets or LP tokens they manage. The bond contracts handle all deposits and
redemptions. Here parameters for monetary policy are configured. Such parameters
are for instance the
[BCV](https://docs.scandao.com/references/glossary#bcv) and the max
individual payout. Below are listed BUSD bond contracts by version, where the
latest version represents the currently active contract.

## BNB Bond

Since BNB is not an ERC-20 token itself, our BNB bonds utilize
[wBNB](https://wbnb.io/). All things being equal to our other bond types, the
only exception for BNB bonds is that we do not mint SCAN against wBNB taken in to
begin with. Below are listed BNB bond contracts by version, where the latest
version represents the currently active contract.
