# Migrate Staked SCAN

To prepare the roll-out of [ScanDAO v1.1](https://scandao.medium.com/olympus-v1-1-a5c6a48be7d1), the staking contract has been upgraded. Users need to migrate their staked SCAN from the old contract to the new one in order to keep receiving rebase rewards.

## How to Migrate Your Staked SCAN

1. Go to the [Migrate page of the ScanDAO website](https://app.scandao.com/#/stake/migrate).
2. In **Staked \(Legacy\)** field, you can see your staked SCAN balance in the old contract. Click "Unstake SSCAN \(Legacy\)" to unstake all of them. If this is your first time to unstake SCAN, you need to approve the contract to spend your DAL token.

3. After the unstaking transaction has completed, you are now in the second stage of the migration process: restake SCAN in the new contract. **Refresh the browser** to make sure your SCAN balance show up correctly on the input field.

4. Approve the contract to spend your SCAN token and wait for the transaction to complete.
5. Click "Stake SCAN \(New\)" to restake your SCAN in the new contract and wait for the transaction to complete.
6. Congratulations! You have now completed the migration process. The **Staked \(New\)** field should show your staked SCAN balance in the new contract. If it does not show the balance correctly, refresh the browser.
