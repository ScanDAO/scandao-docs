# SCAN-BUSD LP Bond

SCAN-BUSD LP bond was introduced on our launch date. It allows you to trade [SCAN-BUSD SLP token](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56&outputCurrency=0xaf2cC765A04a3A4B554f368796Cec2B7eAF44746) in exchange for discounted SCAN on ScanDAO.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have SCAN-BUSD SLP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to PancakeSwap and add liquidity for the [SCAN-BUSD pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56&outputCurrency=0xaf2cC765A04a3A4B554f368796Cec2B7eAF44746) to acquire them.

2. Head to the [SCAN-BUSD SLP Bond page of the ScanDAO website](https://app.scandao.com/#/mints/scan_busd_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of SCAN-BUSD SLP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of SCAN you can purchase.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the ScanDAO contract to spend your SCAN-BUSD SLP tokens. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
