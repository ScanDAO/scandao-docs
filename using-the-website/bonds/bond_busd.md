# BUSD Bond

BUSD bond was introduced on our launch. It allows you to trade [BUSD](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/busd) in exchange for discounted SCAN on ScanDAO.

## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have BUSD in your wallet. For example, you can [go to PancakeSwap to swap for BUSD](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xe9e7cea3dedca5984780bafc599bd69add087d56&outputCurrency=0xaf2cC765A04a3A4B554f368796Cec2B7eAF44746) if you don't have any.

2. Head to the [BUSD Bond page of the ScanDAO website](https://app.scandao.com/#/mints/busd). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of BUSD you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of SCAN you can purchase.

4. If this is your first purchase, you need to approve the ScanDAO contract to spend your BUSD. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, refresh the page. The "Approve" button should be changed to display "Bond" by now.
