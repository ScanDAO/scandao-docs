## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have SCAN-WBNB LP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to PancakeSwap and add liquidity for the [SCAN-WBNB pool](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c&outputCurrency=0xaf2cC765A04a3A4B554f368796Cec2B7eAF44746) to acquire them.

2. Head to the [SCAN-WBNB LP Bond page of the ScanDAO website](https://app.scandao.com/#/mints/scan_wbnb_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of SCAN-WBNB LP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of SCAN you can purchase.
