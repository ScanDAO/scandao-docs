## How to Bond

1. Make sure you have SCAN-WBNB LP tokens in your wallet. You need to go to Sushiswap and add liquidity for the [SCAN-WBNB pool](https://app.sushi.com/add/0x383518188c0c6d7730d91b2c03a03c837814a899/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) to acquire them.

2. Head to the [SCAN-WBNB LP Bond page of the ScanDAO website](https://app.scandao.com/#/bonds/scan_wbnb_lp). There are two tabs: "Bond" and "Redeem". Make sure "Bond" is selected.

3. Type in the amount of SCAN-WBNB LP tokens you would like to bond. Make sure you are not trying to bond more than is allowed. The **Max You Can Buy** field below shows the maximum amount of SCAN you can purchase.
