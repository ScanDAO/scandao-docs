## Values

ScanDAO is building a global, community-owned and decentralized economy so we
can introduce stability and transparency back into financial markets and create
financial inclusion for all.

ScanDAO exists to support projects that bring value to the SCAN economy. The
DAO is driven by the following values:

- Community-run
- Results-oriented
- Sustainable
- Inclusive

While we believe decentralized structures are best suited for achieving this vision,
we realize that some structure is needed to align on common goals, evaluate projects,
create accountability and ensure successful execution.
